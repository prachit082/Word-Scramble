**Simple Mini-Game created in HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript**

If you don’t know, Word Scramble is a game where the letters that can make a meaningful word are shuffled or scrambled randomly, and players have to find out the correct word using those random letters.

## Preview and Summary

In my game, as you have seen in the preview, there is a hint too that helps the user to find the correct word easily. 
Players have to find the correct word in the given time which is 30 seconds. 
If the current word is difficult to find there is a refresh button to get a new word.

Codes shouldn’t be difficult to understand if you already have basic knowledge of the JavaScript objects, array, and for loop.
